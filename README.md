# Ingress IITC Portal Multi Export
This is a plugin to export portals to different formats.

## Features
At the moment we support export of all portals in the current view, bookmarked portals by folders and portals inside a polygon

As formats we currently got: GPX, CSV and export for Maxfield

(check out https://www.ingress-maxfield.com/ for information about Maxfield)

## Requirements
IITC needs to be installed. See this page for information: https://iitc.jonatkins.com/

Additionally the "Bookmarks for maps and portals" and "LiveInventory" plugins are needed for full functionality but the plugin also runs without them

## LiveInventory plugin

https://github.com/EisFrei/IngressLiveInventory/raw/main/liveInventory.user.js

## Install
For installation just click on this link:

https://github.com/trefmanic/Ingress-IITC-Multi-Export/raw/master/multi_export.user.js

Normally Tampermonkey (or the extension you are using for JS) should recognize the format and ask to install the plugin
